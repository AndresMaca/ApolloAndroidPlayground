# ApolloAndroidPlayground
Apollo (mutations, subscriptions) implementation with Android Architecture, Dagger2, ViewModel and LiveData.

You can see apollo query, mutations and subscriptions, i doesnt implement any UI, you can check the behavior  in the log cat, just write DataRepo and see it works, im going to clean the code writing more specific methods.
Maybe Im going to implement UI in the future just ask if you need some help!

To understand more about android Architecture check my movieProject repo!:
